#This program computes the area of a circle


print("Please enter the radius")  #input variable: radius is supposed to be given by user as the print statement says.

radius = 20                       #input statement is required instead assignment.
                                  

pi = 3.14                       
area = pi*(radius**2)             #output variable, area is computed for the circle  

print("Thank you, here is your answer", area)
